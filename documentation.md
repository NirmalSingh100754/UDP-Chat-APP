# UDP Chat App 

## Introduction
Welcome to the documentation for the UDP Chat App! This project is designed to facilitate real-time communication between two users across different systems using the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). The app is simple, lightweight, and works on both Linux and Windows platforms, making it accessible for anyone who wants to chat with a friend or colleague.

## Features
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: The app runs smoothly on both Linux and Windows, allowing users to communicate regardless of their operating system.
- **Multi-threaded Messaging**: It uses threads to send and receive messages at the same time, ensuring a seamless chatting experience.
- **UDP Communication**: The app employs UDP for fast, efficient messaging without the overhead of establishing a connection.
- **Easy Exit**: Users can exit the chat quickly by typing commands like `bye` or `exit`.

## Installation & Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by downloading the source code from the repository to your local machine.

2. **Install Requirements**: Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file. Run the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

   This will install required libraries like `socket` and `thread6`.

3. **Launch the App**: To start chatting, run the application on both systems. When prompted, enter the IP address of the receiver to establish a connection.

## How It Works
- **Binding IP and Ports**: The app binds to the local machine's IP and a specified port (default: 1111 for sending, 2222 for receiving). Make sure both sender and receiver are using the correct IP and port settings.

- **Concurrent Messaging**: The application operates using two threads:
  - One thread handles incoming messages.
  - The other thread manages outgoing messages. This allows users to send and receive messages without interruption.

- **Exiting the Chat**: When you want to leave the conversation, simply type `bye` or `exit`. This will close the application cleanly.

## Important Concepts
- **UDP Protocol**: Unlike TCP, UDP is a connectionless protocol. This means it can send messages without establishing a connection first. While this makes it faster, it can also lead to occasional message loss or delivery out of order.

- **Threading**: By using threading, the app can perform multiple tasks simultaneously. This ensures that users can receive messages even while typing.

## Conclusion
The UDP Chat App is a fun and straightforward way to engage in real-time communication. It showcases the efficiency of UDP and the practicality of multi-threading in a user-friendly manner. Enjoy chatting with your friends and exploring the capabilities of this simple yet powerful application!
